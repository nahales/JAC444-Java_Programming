Task – 1: You are asked to write a discount system for a beauty salon, which provides services and sells beauty products. It offers 3 types of memberships: Premium, Gold and Silver. Premium, gold and silver members receive a discount of 20%, 15%, and 10%, respectively, for all services provided. Customers without membership receive no discount. All members receives a flat 10% discount on products purchased (this might change in future). Your system shall consist of three classes: Customer, Discount and Visit, as shown in the class diagram. It shall compute the total bill if a customer purchases $x of products and $y of services, for a visit. Also write a test program to exercise all the classes.
The class DiscountRate contains only static variables and methods (underlined in the class diagram).
